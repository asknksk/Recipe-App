## React - Recipe App

This project is a comprehensive recipe project I made to learn React Router. I used a different library from regular Css using Style Component for styling. Since there are many examples where I pulled the data with axios before, I got the data from the API with fetch.

- React
- React-Router-Dom (Browser Router- Route - Routes)
